# mp3_meta_data

Currently this prints track length in hours, minutes and seconds to eliminate the need to manually convert tracks from minutes to seconds. Track length in seconds is commonly needed for vinyl manufacturing and some webstore CMS's.

My end goal is to create a module that pulls metadata commonly needed for physical and digital distribution directly from the music files to elimitate errors from copying and pasting from multiple sources, generate reports (ex: new release info form to distributors) and just generally expedite the processes of sharing this data.
